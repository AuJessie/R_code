# Welcome to a script for the Li-600: importing, wrangling and exporting the data. 

# We use the Li-600 to get plant physiology information. We use it to collect measurements on stomatal conductance and fluorescence. 
# There two types of fluorescence measurements, one collected during the daytime (light-adapted leaf) and one collected during the night (dark-adapted leaf). 
# This script will be used for importing the raw data, merging it with meta data files and exporting it for analyses.
